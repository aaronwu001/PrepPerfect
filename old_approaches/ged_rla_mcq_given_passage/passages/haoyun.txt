I love solving problems! I like every part of it, from finishing a 5-minute puzzle to spending hours on a single integral math proof. The satisfaction when I accomplish something always drives me to continue facing a new challenge. It was in high school that I found my passion aligned with computer science. The vastly changing technology and programming projects are free question banks full of challenges for me to encounter.

Since then, exploring new technologies has become my new habit. I tried software development in my freshman summer, developing full-stack web applications on my personal project. I am involved in the flagship of the computer science club and hackathon team in college. I want to continue my passion for exploration and problem-solving and apply it to a greater extent in various industries.
